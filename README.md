# 🧠 Calorie Coach — More Than a Fitness App

### 🌿 Concept
**Calorie Coach** is a smart, human-first nutrition and wellness companion — not just a calorie counter.

It adjusts your goals based on your *real life variables*:
- Stress levels 😫
- Sleep quality 😴
- Household chores 🧹
- Body type 🧍‍♂️
- Spice tolerance 🌶️
- Cooking oil used 🫕
- Need to binge or rest days 🍜
- Emotional & mental fatigue 🧘‍♀️
